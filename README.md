# CausalX: A Production-Ready Causal Learning Library for Industrial Applications
**CausalX** is a python library for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in large-scale industrial applications via State-of-the-Art machine learning techniques. The library is brought by the applied causal learning team at Meta. CausalX provides a series of solutions for time-series causal inference, multi-task multi-treatment causal inference, real-time and long-term causal inference, and more.
